# IOT_WasteManagementSystem

The rate increasing population in our country has increased rapidly and also, we have an increase in garbage which have increased environmental issue. 

In this project, I have designed a simple system called Smart Dustbin using Arduino, Ultrasonic Sensor, LED, Resister and Servo Motor, where the lid of the dustbin will automatically open itself upon detection of human hand and detect the level of the garbage. The smart dustbin is a carefully designed solution that solves the social issue of waste disposal, the smart dustbin identifies the kind of material being thrown inside it and segregates it into bio or non-biodegradable.

Dustbin will open its lid when someone/object is in range of 10cm to 20cm then it will wait for 10 seconds then it will close automatically. Here lid will close when you donâ€™t want to use and it will only open when required.
